Abstract

The role of personality traits and how it pertains to alcohol consumption and stress levels have been a 
focus of many studies. It is speculated that daily alcohol consumption is a coping mechanism for stress 
for those with certain personality types. In previous work it has been shown that many different types 
of personality traits (including extraverts, hopelessness, anxiety, impulsivity and sensation seekers)
have a higher rates of alcohol consumption (Mackinnon, et al., 2014). Research that includes college
students show those who consume alcohol to help cope with the daily stressors not only have more alcohol
-related problems, but they also consume more in a sitting (McCabe, et al., 2013). Identifying personality
traits that have a higher probability for alcohol consumption or dependence would allow for the person to 
become aware of their increased risk.
